# Why is this

I have a few existing rust progects sact (superuser act) and rest (new encore) 
that share alot of similar code... This is the code. There will be another one
like this just to keep code organize and seperate. This also allow be to update 
diffrent components with a cargo build as oppose to having to change the same file
multiple times.

This lib has shared function across most of my projects.
